A. PROJECT PAX
==============

If PDF files are included using pdfTeX, PDF annotations
are stripped. This project tries a solution without
altering pdfTeX. A Java program (pax.jar) parses the PDF file that
will later be included. It writes the data of the annotations
in a file that can be read by TeX. Then a LaTeX package (pax.sty)
extends the graphics package. If a PDF file is included, the package
looks for the file with the annotation data, reads them and puts
the annotations in the right place.

Project status: experimental


B. COPYRIGHT, LICENSE
=====================

The project consists of two parts:
* The Java program pax.jar with sources.
  The Perl wrapper pdfannotextractor.pl.
  License is GPL, see license/gpl.txt.
* The LaTeX package pax.sty.
  License is LPPL 1.3.
The file README belongs to both parts.

The Java program uses the PDF library PDFBox,
see http://pdfbox.apache.org/.

E. REQUIREMENTS
===============

* Java 1.4+.
* PDFBox 0.7.2 or 0.7.3.
  However, PDFAnnotExtractor does not work with the recent
  versions of PDFBox, currently only the older versions
  0.7.2 or 0.7.3 are supported. The older versions are
  available at SourceForge:
    http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=78314
* The Perl wrapper (optional) needs:
  * Perl
  * kpsewhich
  * java in PATH
  The option --install also requires:
  * wget or curl
  * unzip
  * texhash or mktexlsr


F. DOWNLOAD
===========

1. Download pax.tds.zip from CTAN:
     ftp://ftp.ctan.org/tex-archive/install/macros/latex/contrib/pax-tds.zip

2. Download PDFBox-0.7.3.jar from http://www.pdfbox.org/ (22 MB)
     http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/pdfbox/PDFBox-0.7.3.zip?download
   Or install PDFBox as RPM package or whatever.


G. INSTALLATION
===============

Examples are given for linux.

3. Install PDFBox (from its home page, RPM package, ...).
   The wrapper pdfannotextractor.pl looks for the JAR file in directories:
      /usr/share/java/
      /usr/local/share/java/
      TDS:scripts/pax/lib/ (TDS:scripts//)
   assuming one of the following names:
     pdfbox.jar
     PDFBox.jar
     pdfbox-0.7.3.jar
     PDFBox-0.7.3.jar
     pdfbox-0.7.2.jar
     PDFBox-0.7.2.jar

Alternative for 2. and 3.
   * Continue with 4. and 5.a).
   * Call `pdfannotextractor --install' (or with option --debug).
     It downloads PDFBox from its homepage and installs it
     in TEXMFVAR(VARTEXMF) below TDS:scripts/pax/

4. Unzip pax-tds.zip inside the TDS tree, where you want to put this
   project, e.g.:
     unzip pax-tds -d /usr/local/share/texmf
   Don't forget to update the database (texhash, mktexlsr, ...).

5.a) Install the wrapper Perl script pdfannotextractor.pl
     as `pdfannotextractor' somewhere in your PATH (/usr/local/bin,
     /usr/bin, ...).
5.b) Or write a wrapper script or whatever to ease the call of the
     Java program, e.g.:
       #!/bin/sh
       java -cp pax.jar:pdfbox.jar pax.PDFAnnotExtractor "$@"

Version of PDFBox
-----------------
Developing the pax project I have used and tested version 0.7.2,
also the current version 0.7.3 seems to be fine. Older versions
are not supported at all, they may work or do not.


H. USE
======

As example I am using usrguide.pdf (with links from project latex-tds)
that will be included in test.tex:

%%% cut %%% test.tex %%% cut %%%
\documentclass[a4paper,12pt,landscape]{article}
\usepackage[
  hmargin=1in,
  vmargin=1in,
]{geometry}

\usepackage{pdfpages}
% pdfpages loads graphicx

\usepackage{pax}

\iffalse
  \usepackage{hyperref}
  \hypersetup{
    filebordercolor={1 1 0},
  }
\fi

\begin{document}
  \includepdf[pages=-,nup=2x1]{usrguide}
\end{document}
%%% cut %%% test.tex %%% cut %%%

First run the Java program on usrguide.pdf:

  $ java -jar pax.jar usrguide.pdf

It generates usrguide.pax.
Next run pdflatex on test.tex twice at least:

  $ pdflatex test
  $ pdflatex test

Then the links should work.

Additionally package hyperref can be used (replace \iffase by \iftrue).
Then the links can be configured using hyperref settings.
(But keep in mind, the colored links by option colorlinks can't
be changed in included documents.
